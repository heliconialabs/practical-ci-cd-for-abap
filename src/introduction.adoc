== Introduction

ABAP is used for business-critical tasks, basic CI/CD should be the default, not the exception. This document introduces a incremental CI/CD setup possible for all releases 702 and up.

abapGit has used abaplint to check for syntax errors before merges for multiple years, a similar albeit more complex
approach can be used to perform similar checks in a classic SAP landscape where changes are deployed using CTS.

As ABAP is a complicated language, occationaly syntax errors make it into the main branch, the scenario is then fixed in abaplint, and similar errorrs can henceforth be detected.

=== CTS

CTS features is a subset of git??? at least the deployment features?

classic CTS, see "CTS is beautiful" blog

=== Open Source Tooling

Open source tools to encourage an open culture

Delivered independently of the SAP release

Reproduceable on local PC by the developer

=== CI and CD differences

| CI | CD

| Parallel | Sequential
| Speed and flexibility | Safety and auditability
| Merge | Overwrite

=== Landscape

The setup described will take offset in a classic 4 tier system landscape,

[plantuml]
....
skinparam monochrome true

node DEV
node QAS
node PRE
node PRD

DEV -> QAS
QAS -> PRE
PRE -> PRD
....

`DEV`: Source for all CTS transports

`QAS`: User acceptance test by business key users

`PRE`: Important, the development artifacts in this system matches PRD.
Transports are imported to this system just before PRD to secure no syntax errors in PRD after import.

The setup can be expanded with more system tiers and transport routes.
