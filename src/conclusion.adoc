== Conclusion

. No new infrastructure (or limited to the PRE system), cloud solution
. 702 and up
. incremental cloud style evolution
. possible extension with throwaway systems + distributed development
. Self and independently phased CI/CD rollout and upgrade
. Secure, only CTS import
. Secure, only push from DEV,QAS,PRE systems
. Business continuity, fallback to CTS if everything git is down
. Not just referential checks, as things move faster, more exotic scenarios will occur
. Keep development tooling separate from kernel
